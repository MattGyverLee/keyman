# Localization Maintenance

Localization for Keyman is maintained at https://crowdin.com/project/keyman

Downloading and updating files between Keyman and Crowdin happens automatically
on GitHub by way of the Crowdin git integration. The configuration file for all platforms
is a YAML file named `/crowdin.yml`.

The only thing that needs to be done manually is to update `crowdin.yml` if new files get added
(and of course translating the strings on the [Crowdin website](https://crowdin.com/project/keyman)).

## Manual up- and download with Crowdin CLI

The following describes how alternatively the Crowdin CLI (v3) tool could be used to
automate downloading and updating files between Keyman and Crowdin.

On Windows, use `crowdin.bat` instead of `crowdin` for all the syntax below.

### Add File

When adding new files to https://crowdin.com/project/keyman/settings#files
also go to the file "Settings" and edit **Resulting file after translations export:**.
This is where the translated files will appear in the Crowdin download (`Keyman.zip`) which also
determines where the translated files get extracted locally into the Keyman project.

For example, `android/KMEA/strings.xml` string uses

```
/android/KMEA/app/src/main/res/values-%android_code%/strings.xml
```

### Setup

Install the [Crowdin CLI (v3)](https://support.crowdin.com/cli-tool-v3/) for your OS.
Note, it has a prerequisite on Java 8.

#### Environment Variables

In Crowdin, create a [personal access token](https://crowdin.com/settings#api-key)
and set it as an environment variable `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.

Also copy the [project id](https://crowdin.com/project/keyman/settings#api)
from API v2 and set it as an environment variable `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID`.

#### Testing Crowdin CLI is Set Up Correctly

To check your CLI setup, in the repo root folder,

```bash
crowdin list project
```

You should see the CLI fetching project info and generating a list of files associated with the
project.

### Downloading from Crowdin

To download the latest translations from Crowdin (all platforms), open a command line at the repo
root folder and run:

```bash
crowdin download
```

To download latest translations for the specific language:

```bash
crowdin download -l {language_code}
```

To display a list of latest translations from Crowdin:

```bash
crowdin download --dryrun
```

### Uploading to crowdin

To upload source files to Crowdin:

```bash
crowdin upload sources
```

## Tip

Microsoft offers a website that allows to check how terms used in Windows are translated
in different languages: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/language/Search.
